# -Project-1---RTVC-
The main objective of a system was to provide easy and effortless access to the end users for the interaction with Traffic Police and RTO (Regional Transport Office). “Road Transport and Violation Control System” included several services like E-Wallet for legal document management that are related to vehicle and driver, pay fine in case of traffic violations, get traffic alerts, notification for towed vehicles, check history for all the previously made traffic violations, traffic violation acts and the fine amount according to those acts, user's complaints and many more. This Android Application has been developed using ‘Android Studio’ and ‘Firebase’- a real time database provided by ‘Google’. The main idea was to make the services digitalize so that they can be use faster and easier compare to a present system.
